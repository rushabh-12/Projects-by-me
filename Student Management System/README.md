***This is a student management system project based on Python and Sqlite3.***

We have used concepts of python such as tkinter, messagebox, matplotlib, numpy, requests, bs4(BeautifulSoup).
Also, Sqlite3 concepts such as select, insert, update, delete.

The current city temperature and quote of the day were fetched from different API's.

In this project the functionalities were as follows:
1. Add a student data(roll no, name, marks)
2. View the added data from the student database.
3. Update some of the existing student data.
4. Delete a student data.
5. Show the data in a bar plot using matplotlib.

A validation function is added for add, view, update, delete window to show warnings and errors.
